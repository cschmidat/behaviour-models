# Neural Network Sound Discrimination Models
In this repository, we explore simple neural networks to model behavioral performance of mice in a sound discrimination task.

The models are defined in `models.py` and explored in the `fresh_analysis.ipynb` notebook.

The results of this analysis are published in: Christian Schmid, Muhammad Haziq, Melissa M. Baese-Berk, James M. Murray, Santiago Jaramillo: *Passive exposure to task-relevant stimuli enhances categorization learning* ([eLife 2023](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.88406.2)).
